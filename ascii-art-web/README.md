Implemention details:

Input Handling: The algorithm first reads user input and validates it to ensure itâ€™s compatible with the ASCII art style. (standard, shadow, thinkertoy)

Text-to-ASCII Mapping: Each character in the input is matched with pre-defined ASCII patterns. The program retrieves the correct ASCII representation for each character.

Line Assembly: Characters are assembled line by line to create the final ASCII image, ensuring each row aligns properly.

Output Rendering: Finally, the assembled ASCII text is formatted and displayed on the webpage.
